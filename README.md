# What are Compound AI Systems?

- Compound AI Systems are artificial intelligence systems designed to perform multiple AI tasks and techniques.
- Components include APIz, RAG, web searching, and browsing, all working together to achieve more complex and robust functionalities.
- The output of one component is verified and supported by other components, allowing the system to perform complex tasks effectively.

# What are AI Agents?

- AI Agents help automate tasks by acting as smart assistants that operate independently.
- They gather information from their surroundings, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals.
  - Examples: Answering questions, driving a car, managing tasks.
- Some agents are simple, reacting immediately to changes (e.g., a thermostat).
- These agents can learn and improve over time, adapting to new situations.
- AI agents are found in:
  - Virtual assistants like Siri
  - Customer service chatbots
  - Autonomous vehicles
  - Video games controlling non-player characters (NPCs)

# What is the relation between Compound AI Systems and AI Agents?

- AI Agents perform tasks individually.
- Compound AI Systems combine multiple AI Agents, each with its specialized role.
- These systems coordinate the agents to achieve complex tasks.
- The relationship between AI Agents and Compound AI Systems enables the creation of more powerful, adaptable, and scalable AI solutions.

# What is the difference between Fine Tuning and RAG?

- Fine-tuning:
  - Adapts a model to perform better on a specific task.
  - Involves updating the model's internal parameters with new data.
  - Requires:
    * Large datasets and complex parameters
    * Expertise
    * High computational power

- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):
  - Enhances the generative capabilities of a model.
  - Retrieves and uses relevant external information to inform responses.
